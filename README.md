# Transcription-Factor-DNA-binding-prediction

Introduction
The goal of this project is both to have some hands-on experience on real-world machine learning
problems, and to potentially solve a very challenging problem in biology.
This project is team-based. Each team can have at most four members, and at least two members.
Projects of larger teams will be graded with higher expectations.
